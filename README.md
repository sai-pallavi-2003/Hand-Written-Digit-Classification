# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification Using the KNN Algorithm.

# Project Brief:
The aim of this project is to classify or is to identify the handwritten digits taken from the MNIST dataset using the KNN Algorithm.

## The KNN Algorithm:
* KNN stands for the Kth Nearest neighbour, it is one of the simplest Machine Learning Algorithm based on Supervised Learning technique.
* KNN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. 
* This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.
